Move to the Downloads folder by using the following command:

cd /home/[username]/Downloads

The installation package you downloaded needs to be made executable before it can be used further. Run the following command for this purpose:

 chmod 755 [package name]
 chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run
 
 It is important to verify if the package can be executed by the current user. The execute permission can be checked through the following command:
 
 ls -l [package name]
 ls -l xampp-linux-x64-8.0.3-0-installer.run
 The -rwxr output shows that the file can be executed by the user whose name is also mentioned in the output.
 
 As a privileged root user, run the following command in order to launch the graphical setup wizard.
 
 sudo ./[package name]
sudo ./xampp-linux-x64-8.0.3-0-installer.run
